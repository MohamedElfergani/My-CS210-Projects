Download the two source code files of sample code named Temperature.java and TemperatureConverter.java.   Those two files make a standalone program which converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to Celsius.

For this assignment, write a JUnit test case to test two methods in the Temperature class.  Test the toCelsius method, and also write a test case to test the toFahrenheit method.  You can write both test cases in one class file, which should be a JUnit test file.

Note, during the class lecture we will discuss and review the JUnit tool, which is a unit test tool plugin for Eclipse.  I will walk you through this assignment during class.
