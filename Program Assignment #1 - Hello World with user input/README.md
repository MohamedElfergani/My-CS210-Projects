Modify your Hello World program to include the following:


Prompt the user to enter a string as input.
Include a method, named printMessage.  The method should accept a String as a parameter, which will be the output it prints using a println statement.
When you call the printMessage method from main, include the method call inside a for loop, so that the method gets called 5 times.
Experiment with different method calls, passing different string arguments to the print method.
Example, if I call the printMessage method from main, and pas it the string "Seattle Seahawks", the output should appear as following:

Seattle Seahawks
Seattle Seahawks
Seattle Seahawks
Seattle Seahawks
